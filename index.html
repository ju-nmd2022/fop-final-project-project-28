      <h1>Backstory</h1>
      <p>
        There once was an evil wizard called Everlore. He wanted all fairies and
        their magic all to himself. One by one the fairies turned into blobs
        with no magical powers left as Everlore absorbed it all himself. Now he
        has captured you and he turned you into a blob! You must score as high
        as possible to get a chance to escape Everlore's tower. Jump on the
        bricks as they get closer, but watch out for the occasional icicles that
        he sends down. Good luck!
